        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>
            There are two <a href="www.netbeans.org">NetBeans 8</a> projects, 
            JVisa and JVisaOscilloscope, which compile into libraries in the 
            "dist" folder, JVisa.jar and JVisaOscilloscope.jar respectively. Use
            JVisaOscilloscope for VISA compliant oscilloscopes and JVisa for all
            other VISA compliant instruments. You have to download a VISA DLL 
            into a classpath folder since I cannot distribute it here for 
            copyright reasons. I got mine from 
            <a href="www.tektronix.com">Tektronix</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>Configurations for win32 and win64</h1>
        <p>
            To achieve loading either JnaVisa32.jar or JnaVisa64.jar, 
            information of the 
            <a href=https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=148590">
                thread
            </a> was used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two property files were added to nbproject.configs: win32.properties
            and win64.properties. They contain references to a win32 and win64 
            library folder respectively and are used in 
            project.properties.run.classpath. To build a particular 
            configuration it has to be selected in the NetBeans IDE pull-down 
            list, and the Java platform has to be switched accordingly pointing 
            to either "Program Files (x86)/java/jdk&lt;version&gt;" (win32) or 
            "Program Files/java/jdk&lt;version&gt;" (win64).
        </p>
        <h1>VisaLibrary.ViStatus</h1>
        <p>
            visa.h defines this type as a function pointer to an error handler. 
            I could not get installing an error handler to work (visa.h function
            viInstallHandler). Also, because JNA does not allow the pointer to a
            Callback object to be retrieved, I had to obtain the pointer value 
            by parsing the string returned by visaStatus.toString().
        </p>
        <h1>Unsigned Types</h1>
        <p>
            Java 8 can treat objects of type Integer and Long as unsigned. 
            Should I make use of it in the get and set functions for attributes?
        </p>
        <h1>_WIN64 Compilation Switch</h1>
        <p>
            JNAerator -D switch does not work as expected (see 
            jnaeratorCommandline.txt). Adding -D_VI_INT64_UINT64_DEFINED and 
            -D_VISA_ENV_IS_64_BIT to the command line was sufficient.
        </p>
        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>
            I decided to use TestNG and not JUnit. There are two suites in Test 
            Packages, JVisaSuite.xml and JVisaSuiteNoInstrument.xml. You can use
            the latter to test communication (by means of function calls) with 
            the VISA DLL. The former you can use to also test communication with
            any VISA compliant instrument.
        </p>
        <p>
            All classes derived from jvisa use one logger (java.util.logging) 
            that gets instantiated in the super class (jvisa). By default its 
            level is set to SEVERE. Since it is declared as public you can 
            change its settings, you can for instance remove the file handler to
            disable file logging.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tests were run successfully on a Windows 7 64-bit machine. I did not
            test with other operating systems.
